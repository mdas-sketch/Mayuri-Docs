This is a test repository for testing.
<H2>How do we create a repository with GitHub?</H2>
<ul>
  <li>Log in to GitHub.
  <li>In the upper right corner of the screen, click the + sign next to your avatar or identicon, and then select New repository.</li>
  <li>Enter the preferred name for your repository.</li>
  <li>Write a short description.</li>
  <li>Select Initialize this repository with a README.</li>
  <li>Click Create repository.</li>
  <li>This original repository created in the GitHub server is called the “upstream”.</li>
</ul>
After creating the repository, the first thing we should do is to make a copy of the upstream, which, in Git terms is referred to as “forking” or creating a “fork” of the upstream. Basically, when you fork a repo, it will be moved to your preferred organization from its original.
<h2>Forking the created repository</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    You will be prompted to select the preferred organization to which you want to fork the repo.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Cloning the forked repository</h2>
<ul>
   <li> Click “Clone or download” in the screen of the forked repo.</li>
  <li>Click the Copy button to copy the URL of the forked repo.</li>
  <li>In a new Terminal tab, navigate to the preferred location in which you want to save the cloned repo and execute the below command.</li>
</ul>
